# Using Kotlin Coroutines
This is an example of using coroutines in kotlin <b>async/await</b> to complete asynchronous tasks. In this example we query both message and mail ID from Database asynchronously and await until they both are queried to send the mail through sendMail() function and after we get awaited response from sendMail() we print a success message.
